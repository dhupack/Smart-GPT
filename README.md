Developed an AI Agent Chatbot using LangGraph, LangChain, and Google Gemini, integrating tool calls (web search, calculator, stock API) for dynamic reasoning and real-time responses.

Implemented persistent multi-threaded conversations with SQLite checkpointing and a Streamlit UI for interactive chat history management.

Enhanced the chatbot with function calling and tool-augmented workflows, enabling autonomous decision-making and external data retrieval.

Built a modular, production-ready architecture supporting conversation memory, tool execution, and extensible agent capabilities.
